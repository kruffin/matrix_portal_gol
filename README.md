## Introduction
This code came from Adafruit here: https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-matrices-matrix-panels-with-circuitpython/example-conways-game-of-life

It has been modified to work with the Matrix Portal.

The master branch has additional changes to color each cell based on how long
it has lived.

The original branch has the code with minor changes to work with the Matrix Portal.
